<h1>Personal website of Stephan Juricke </h1>
<p>On this website I'm presenting my research interests, provide insights into my research and outreach activities
relevant links to scientific and science communication material as well
as scientific and other publications.</p>
<h2> Research Interests </h2>
<p> I am interested in the workings of the climate system and specifically the role of the ocean and sea ice
components as well as their interactions with the atmosphere. The methods I am using are general 
circulation models such the ocean models <a href="https://fesom.de" target="_blank">FESOM2</a> and 
<a href="https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/" target="_blank">NEMO</a> and the climate models
<a href="https://github.com/AWI-CM3" target ="_blank">AWI-CM3</a> and 
<a href=https://ec-earth.org/" target ="_blank">EC-Earth</a>. 
These models can be used to predict changes in the ocean circulation 
and the climate system. They can be employed as testbeds for investigate the consequences of
certain environmental actions or scenarios and can help us to better understand
the complex interactions of processes and scales in the atmosphere and oceans.</p>
